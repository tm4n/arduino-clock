arduino-clock
=============

Setable two-button clock with arduino uno, ds1302 clock chip and tm1637 display controller.
It also keeps and displays the date. Copyright to the included libraries belongs to their owners. the tm1637 library has been modified to allow other glyphs to be displayed.

"temp_clock" code also has a dht22 sensor and can display the temperature and humidity. I removed that code from "clock" because the sensor readings were not reliable in the casing I build for the clock.

"stop_clock" will add a stopwatch, but viewing date will no longer be available.

Schematics will be added.
