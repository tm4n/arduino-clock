arduino-clock
=============

Setable two-button clock with arduino uno, ds1302 clock chip and tm1637 display controller.
It also keeps and displays the date.

"temp_clock" code also has a dht22 sensor and can display the temperature and humidity. I removed that code from "clock" because the sensor readings were not reliable in the casing I build for the clock.

I plan to add a stopwatch and maybe a timer to the basic clock, to make it a more useable kitchen help for me.
Schematics and pictures of the final product will be added.
